    <p>Okay, this admittedly isn't my finest work, and I know what you're wondering: why is Hamilton on an edit for <em>your</em> birthday? Well, these are things I think about when I think of you, i.e. Percy Jackson, cute animals, and Harry Potter (I was gonna put Harry/Hermione, but decided not to push it, especially since at the end of the day friendships are the most important!). However, I also think back fondly to all our APUSH timelines, arguing over the most significant events and agonizing over what rankings to give each category. I equally remember your AHamz sketch in my yearbook, and how everyone would pause on the page to note their appreciation and slight bemusement. I miss having you in my classes and seeing you every day, and I wish I were there for your birthday to bring you Oreos and chocolate and high-rated movies.</p> 

    <p>In any case, no matter where we are or how old we get, I hope you know that I always wish you all the very very best. I don't care how busy I am -- I want you to always feel free to message me anytime you want with any updates or questions or requests for help, because hearing from you is always a great honor. You're also one of the few people whose Buzzfeed articles I will read all the way, and if there exists a greater sign of love, well I haven't found it yet.</p>

    <p>You're probably already working yourself hard and immersed in work, but let's make time to Facetime now and then! I really do hope to be able to visit you at Dartmouth sooner rather than later, and that's the only thing that makes me regret that our schedules align along the quarter system. Until then, keep in touch and make the most out of your last quarter before a well-deserved break!

                <p>I figure now that you have a Macbook you can finally enjoy epubs in iBooks in all their glory, so here are <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/p7rjluycpwlx9tr/AABRZMW4Eit_3lnjeEGK91HMa?dl=0">awesome books that I've read relatively recently in the past few years</a> that I absolutely loved and wish to discuss with someone. <i>Red Rising</i> in particular was the most I've been invested in a series in a long time, just a great, well-written Sci-Fi series reminiscent of <i>The Hunger Games</i>, <i>Percy Jackson</i>, and <i>Ender's Game</i> about a kid on a quest to bring about social justice in a caste-driven society (it's a lot better than I can possible explain).   

                <p>I also do know you're not the biggest eBook fan, so here's a <a href="http://bit.ly/1Fl4lWj">Barnes & Nobles gift card</a> if you ever find time to read and want a nice print book. Either way, I expect recommendations and/or reviews no matter what you end up choosing!</p>

                <p>Finally, here are <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/h3g90o8t3rfzke5/AADSQIZqzksS8T3O4qyMSRwOa?dl=0">pictures of Samoyeds</a> for no particular reason except that they make me insanely happy, and so I hope they will have even 5% of the same effect on you.</div>
